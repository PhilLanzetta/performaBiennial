Selldorf Architects was selected in July 2021 as lead of a multidisciplinary team to create a more welcoming and accessible National Gallery on the occasion of the upcoming 2024 bicentenary. Working alongside Purcell, Vogt Landscape and Arup, the scope includes remodeling parts of the Sainsbury Wing, the public realm, as well as a new Research Centre and Members House in the Wilkins Building. A revived, more open Sainsbury foyer will receive more natural light and offer views of Trafalgar Square and Westminster. The public realm concepts include a new public square in front of the Sainsbury Wing with planting and seating.\nFor more information, visit the National Gallery’s NG200 website [here](https://ng200.org.uk/our-proposals/)."},"team":[{"name":"Akito Aiba","slug":"akito-aiba","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"6600af8d-d62d-5d2a-8c1d-070b3bb973a2"},{"name":"Egle Kucaite","slug":"egle-kucaite","primaryOffice":"No Longer Employed","id":"22450087-92f4-5c95-91ae-e24d901cb7bd"},{"name":"Sunmin Park","slug":"sunmin-park","primaryOffice":"No Longer Employed","id":"b04ad37b-f75a-5e40-bc54-7fa93fed433f"},{"name":"Wei Jien","slug":"wei-jien","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"cdf1630a-c99b-52be-a052-1d801938caee"}],"press":null,"photoCredit":["National Gallery"],"projectLeader":[{"name":"Leah Xandora","slug":"leah-xandora","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"a23c520d-b7f7-5ebb-abb8-76dd1f2c48c0"}],"metadata":{"tags":[]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"national-gallery-london"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1395536887","143701507"],"slicesMap":{}}
