A family of lighting objects, such as bamboo light sticks, floating balloon fixtures, and stone elements provide ambient lighting on various scales. Additionally, architectural elements are lit from within to create a glow.\n\nDuring those moments when the activity on two of the three sites correspond, a beam of light will shoot into the air from each site above the harbour. A 3-dimensional visual connection, link and dialogue is created, bridging both sides of the harbour. When there is corresponding activity on all three sides, the beams will create a prism, which will act as an iconic gateway into Hong Kong.\n\nThis lighting spectacle will occur only on special occasions and will have a spectacular impact, visible from all parts of the city."},"team":null,"press":null,"photoCredit":null,"projectLeader":null,"metadata":{"tags":[]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"hong-kong-harbor-master-plan-competition"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1395536887","143701507"],"slicesMap":{}}
