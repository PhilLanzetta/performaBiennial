Perfectly situated in the center of Hudson Yards on the famed Highline, architecture firm Diller, Scofidio + Renfro created a “quatrefoil design of four graceful arcs of glass with maximal views of Hudson River”. Towering over 900 feet tall and connecting to the Cultural Shed, a state of the art mobile performance hub, creating a dynamic addition to the New York City profile.\n\nL’Observatoire International created a lighting design to further accentuate the rounded features of the exterior, designating the building as graceful giant among its geometric piers and was instrumental in creating an interior lobby that would exhibit the buildings permanent art installation by the artist concept Joel Shapiro.\n\nOn the exterior, incorporated spots at the pinches of the clover-shaped crown create a soft gradation of cool light down the façade where lighting at the internal face of the foundation columns ground the overall tower. Uplighting to trees cast dappled light onto the base softening the exterior at street level with integrated lighting at the floor giving a warm wash to the glass curtain that outlines the walkways.\n\nBringing the focus into the lobby, L’Observatoire was tasked with creating a totally neutral space to exhibit a suspended sculpture by Joel Shapiro. Using layers of integrated light to millwork, downlights and washes to vertical surfaces created an even diffused light eliminating any shadows that would allude to mass. The sculpture appears synonymous with the architectural details of the interior effortlessly floating in space.\n\nL’Observatoire International approached the design using light to emphasize form and volume.  Working with light and shadow or completely dissolving the two creates an additional level to the design, transforming the experience and perception of space."},"team":[{"name":"Ellisrael Daing","slug":"ellisrael-daing","primaryOffice":"No Longer Employed","id":"cfd12123-7e06-51d9-9679-e4a3de8c5100"},{"name":"Esteban Varas","slug":"esteban-varas","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"88689f69-2c82-543f-8248-de5e9ed152a8"},{"name":"Jeff Taylor","slug":"jeff-taylor","primaryOffice":"No Longer Employed","id":"c285a79c-c1fd-5de1-ab48-7a719a81a419"},{"name":"Mikael Charpin","slug":"mikael-charpin","primaryOffice":"No Longer Employed","id":"9f4853d6-0a13-5040-8afd-3dd169a4d3ae"},{"name":"Papon Kasettratat","slug":"papon-kasettratat","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"75c19578-0d40-572f-8997-505bf3a3359b"}],"press":null,"photoCredit":["Courtesy of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group"],"projectLeader":[{"name":"Carlos Garcia","slug":"carlos-garcia","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"54900713-93a6-5e01-9a98-3c32204d99f7"}],"metadata":{"tags":[]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"15-hudson-yards"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1395536887","143701507"],"slicesMap":{}}
