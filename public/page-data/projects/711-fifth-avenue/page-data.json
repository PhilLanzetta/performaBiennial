Originally designed by Bethlehem Engineering Corporation and completed in 1927, the 340,000-square-foot building was presented with a design award by the Fifth Avenue Association for its elegance and beauty.\n\nOne of only 20 boutique office buildings along Fifth Avenue, 711 Fifth Avenue has served as headquarters to notable corporations including NBC, Columbia Pictures, and Coca-Cola. The building’s 56,000-square-foot retail and restaurant space has attracted destination retailers and restaurants, such as La Côte Basque, the famed Le Pavillon, and Ralph Lauren. The building is also home to Ralph Lauren’s renowned restaurant, Polo Bar and the recently announced CORE:NYC.\n\nSHVO acquired the building in September 2019 and has reimagined 711 Fifth Avenue under the direction of a world-renowned design architect Peter Marino. The lobby was revitalized with an emphatic hospitality sensibility featuring tailored artisanal finishes that reinforce a signature identity and ambiance with curated art and collector grade furniture. Sophisticated infrastructure upgrades augment a contemporary and seamless tenant experience."},"team":null,"press":null,"photoCredit":["Courtesy of SHVO"],"projectLeader":[{"name":"Wei Jien","slug":"wei-jien","primaryOffice":"New York","id":"cdf1630a-c99b-52be-a052-1d801938caee"}],"metadata":{"tags":[]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"711-fifth-avenue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1395536887","143701507"],"slicesMap":{}}
